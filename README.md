# Introduction

This project was inspired by **nihongo‑anki‑gen**.  

When using Anki, I often face the problem of having too many vocabulary items, making it impossible to add them manually. As a learner preparing for the JLPT exam, I am busy with deadlines and do not have much time to study Japanese. The most effective way for me to learn is through vocabulary with example sentences and Han‑Viet readings. Therefore, I created this project to automate the process of learning Japanese vocabulary.

**The Goal**  
Automating the creation of Japanese Anki flashcards to save time and make vocabulary learning more effective.
